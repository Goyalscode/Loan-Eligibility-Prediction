### Steps to manually run the project on local system</br></br>
Navigate to the path (in command prompt) where you want to download project files, then run -
```
>  git clone https://github.com/Goyalscode/Loan-Eligibility-Prediction.git
>  cd Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
```
</br>Make sure you have python installed on the system, if not then run - 
```
>  pip install python
```
</br>Then we create a virtual environment, where we install the required packages, libraries after activating it, using
```
>  pip install virtualenv
>  python -m venv ven
>  ven\Scripts\activate
>  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note - We have to run the above commands only the first time we run the project, to install the requirements</br>
, but every time we need to run the 3rd command to activate the virtual environment, if we reopen the command prompt, or deactivate the environment</br>
</br>Then run the application using the command -
```
>  python app.py
```
The above command will open the application on localhost at 127.0.0.1:5000.
